## What's This All About?

Yo, welcome to my Mini Games Collection project, folks! ðŸ˜Ž This is where the fun begins. So, here's the deal: I've got three super cool games for you - Hangman, Guess the Word, and Guess the Number, all wrapped up in Java awesomeness.

## What's in the Bag?

### Hangman

- Think you're good with words? Cool! Hangman randomly picks a word from my stash.
- Your job? Guess the letters and complete that hidden word.
- Oh, but watch out - you've only got a limited number of chances before it's game over. ðŸ˜‰

### Guess the Word

- Feeling like a word wizard? Try this one! I've scrambled a word for you.
- You get hints and multiple shots at unscrambling it.
- We're keeping score on your attempts, buddy!

### Guess the Number

- Fancy yourself a number guru? Give it a shot! I'm thinking of a number within a range.
- Make your guess, and I'll tell you if it's too high or too low.
- Keep guessing until you crack the code, and we'll count your tries!
